# Test Report: STORY-002 - Conditionally Summarize Trial Search Results

**Date:** 2025-06-27

**Tester:** Senior Developer & QA Architect

**Objective:** To verify that the `/api/trials/search` endpoint correctly implements conditional AI summarization as per the acceptance criteria in [STORY-002](docs/stories/story-002-conditional-summarization.md).

## 1. Summary of Results

All automated tests passed successfully. The API is functioning as expected and meets all the acceptance criteria for the conditional summarization feature.

| Test Plan                               | Status  |
| :-------------------------------------- | :------ |
| [Test Plan 002](docs/test-plans/test-plan-002.md) | Passed |

## 2. Test Execution Details

-   **Test Suite:** `src/api.test.js`
-   **Test Environment:** Local development environment with a PostgreSQL database.
-   **Data:** The database was seeded with real data from `ClinicalTrials.gov` and a specific test trial to ensure all conditions could be tested.

## 3. Conclusion

The conditional summarization feature has been successfully tested and validated. The API now correctly returns summaries for small result sets and only trial IDs for large result sets, and it properly caches summaries to avoid redundant AI service calls. The feature is now ready for production.
