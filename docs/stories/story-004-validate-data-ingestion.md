# User Story: Validate and Optimize Data Ingestion Pipeline

**ID:** STORY-004
**Epic:** [Trial Search & Discovery MVP](epics/epic-001-trial-search-mvp.md)
**Status:** To Do
**Priority:** Critical

## 1. Description

As a Product Owner and a user, I need to ensure that the data ingestion process from `ClinicalTrials.gov` is accurate, performant, and complete. Before building more features that rely on this data, we must validate that the information in our internal database is a trustworthy reflection of the source and that the ingestion process is efficient.

## 2. Acceptance Criteria

1.  **GIVEN** a set of 5-10 specific `NCTID`s (trial IDs)
    **WHEN** the data for these trials is ingested into our database
    **THEN** the key fields (`TrialID`, `Title`, `Condition`, `Location`, `Phase`, `Summary`) in our database must exactly match the data on the official `ClinicalTrials.gov` website, confirming **data accuracy**.

2.  **GIVEN** a broad search query (e.g., "cancer") is performed on the `ClinicalTrials.gov` website, returning a total count of trials
    **WHEN** our ingestion script is configured to fetch all trials for the same query
    **THEN** the total number of records in our `ClinicalTrials` table should match the count from the official website, confirming **data completeness**.

3.  **GIVEN** the data ingestion script is configured to fetch a larger dataset (e.g., 1,000 trials)
    **WHEN** the script is executed
    **THEN** its total execution time should be measured and documented, confirming **data speed** is acceptable for a daily batch process.

4.  **GIVEN** the `db/fetch-and-seed.js` script
    **THEN** it must be refactored to be easily configurable, allowing the search query and the number of trials to fetch to be passed in as arguments, rather than being hardcoded.

## 3. Technical Notes

*   A new automated test script should be created to perform the data validation checks outlined in the acceptance criteria.
*   This may involve creating a new QA/testing module that can make live API calls to `ClinicalTrials.gov` for the purpose of comparison.
*   The focus is on validating the core data pipeline before adding more user-facing features.
