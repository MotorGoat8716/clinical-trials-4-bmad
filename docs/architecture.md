# Architecture Document: Clinical Trials Resource Hub (Patient-Centric ClinicalTrials.gov Wrapper)

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** June 27, 2025
**Status:** Proposed

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the high-level architecture for the Clinical Trials Resource Hub MVP as a patient-centric wrapper around ClinicalTrials.gov. The primary goal is to maintain 100% data parity with the authoritative clinical trials database while adding patient-friendly enhancements including plain language summaries, medical glossary, and AVA conversational guidance. The architecture emphasizes **data integrity**, **real-time synchronization**, and **cost-effectiveness** for the initial launch.

## 2. Guiding Principles (Wrapper Architecture)

*   **Source Authority:** Maintain ClinicalTrials.gov as the single source of truth with direct API integration for current data.
*   **Complete Feature Parity:** Implement all ClinicalTrials.gov search filters and parameters to ensure full dataset access.
*   **Data Integrity:** Never modify source data; enhance through layered features (summaries, glossary) clearly distinguished from official information.
*   **Real-time Synchronization:** Ensure platform data remains current through efficient ClinicalTrials.gov API integration.
*   **Cost-Effective Enhancement:** Optimize AI and enhancement features for cost control while maintaining data parity.
*   **Transparent Enhancement:** Clearly distinguish platform enhancements from authoritative ClinicalTrials.gov data.

## 3. High-Level Architecture (ClinicalTrials.gov Wrapper)

The MVP implements a comprehensive wrapper around ClinicalTrials.gov with the following components designed for data integrity and patient accessibility.

### 3.1. Key Components & Technology Choices

| Component | Technology/Strategy | Rationale for Cost-Effectiveness |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User Interface (UI)** | React/Vue.js | Standard, efficient web frameworks. No mobile app in MVP to reduce complexity. |
| **Backend Services** | Node.js/Python (Monolithic or few services) | A simplified backend structure reduces deployment and maintenance overhead for the MVP. |
| **ClinicalTrials.gov Integration** | **Real-time API Integration with Intelligent Caching** | Direct integration with ClinicalTrials.gov API for real-time data access. Intelligent caching prevents redundant API calls while ensuring data currency. Implements all official search parameters. |
| **Database** | **PostgreSQL (Managed Service) + Caching Layer** | Managed PostgreSQL for user data and cached trial information. Includes full-text search capabilities and structured caching of ClinicalTrials.gov responses with timestamp tracking. |
| **Search Service** | **Hybrid ClinicalTrials.gov API + PostgreSQL** | Primary searches utilize ClinicalTrials.gov API with comprehensive filter support. PostgreSQL provides caching, user-specific data (saved trials), and enhanced search features. |
| **AVA AI Service** | **Google Gemini API (or similar)** | The core of the AI functionality. |
| **AVA Cost Control** | **Controlled Summarization Logic** | This is the most critical cost-control measure. As defined in the PRD, AVA will only generate summaries when the search result set is small (e.g., <=10). This prevents uncontrolled LLM API calls and associated costs. |
| **Authentication** | Managed Auth Service (e.g., Supabase Auth, Auth0) | Reduces development time and security risks associated with building a custom authentication service. |
| **Hosting** | Serverless or PaaS (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, AWS ECS) | Pay-for-what-you-use models are ideal for an MVP with variable initial traffic. |

### 3.2. Data Flow for Trial Search (Wrapper Architecture)

1.  **User Initiates Search:** User enters query using comprehensive filter interface matching ClinicalTrials.gov functionality.
2.  **Filter Translation:** Backend translates user interface selections to official ClinicalTrials.gov API parameters.
3.  **Cache Check:** System checks for cached results matching exact search parameters within acceptable freshness window.
4.  **API Query:** If cache miss or stale data, system queries ClinicalTrials.gov API with complete filter parameters.
5.  **Data Enhancement:** 
    *   Raw ClinicalTrials.gov data is cached with timestamp
    *   For result sets â‰¤10 trials, AVA generates plain language summaries
    *   Medical terms are identified and linked to glossary definitions
    *   Distance calculations added if location services enabled
6.  **Response Assembly:** Combined response includes:
    *   Official ClinicalTrials.gov data with direct source links
    *   Platform enhancements clearly marked as supplementary
    *   Pagination and sorting matching source functionality
7.  **Display:** UI presents enhanced data while maintaining clear connection to authoritative source.

## 4. Enhanced Features (V2+ Roadmap)

While maintaining the core wrapper architecture, future versions will add:
*   **Symptom Tracker Integration:** Patient symptom monitoring with trial correlation
*   **Medication & Appointment Reminders:** Intelligent reminder system for trial participation
*   **Patient Journey Documentation:** Tools for documenting trial experience and outcomes
*   **Advanced Analytics:** Enhanced reporting for patient insights while maintaining privacy
*   **Multi-language Support:** Internationalization for broader patient access
*   **Advanced AI Features:** Enhanced conversational capabilities while preserving data integrity

## 5. Data Integrity Safeguards

*   **Source Validation:** All trial data includes ClinicalTrials.gov verification links
*   **Enhancement Labeling:** Clear UI indicators distinguish platform features from official data
*   **Synchronization Monitoring:** Automated alerts for API connectivity issues or data staleness
*   **Audit Trails:** Complete logging of data sources and enhancement processes

This wrapper architecture ensures patients receive the complete, authoritative ClinicalTrials.gov dataset through an enhanced, accessible interface while maintaining unwavering commitment to data integrity and source transparency.
