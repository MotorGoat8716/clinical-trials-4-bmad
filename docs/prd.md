    * **Key Pain Points (MVP Focus):**
        1.  Similar to patients, focusing on the burden of information gathering and simplification for the patient.
        2.  Need for a reliable, easy-to-digest source to explain concepts to the patient.

### 3.2. Future Target Audience (V2+):

* Researchers/Trial Coordinators: (Retained as future audience for expanded features like trial listing and advanced communication tools).

### 3.3. User Personas (Illustrative Examples - Note: Detailed personas will be elaborated post-MVP validation to include full journeys beyond initial discovery):

* Overwhelmed Olivia - Olivia is a middle-aged woman, full-time working mom with small children. She has just been diagnosed with aggressive Stage III triple negative breast cancer. Olivia is distraught and filled with emotions and concern for her family. Between child raising, work, home responsibilities and maintaining her spousal and family relationships, Olivia is overwhelmed with barely enough time to look into clinical trials that could save her life, or at least improve her quality of life during treatment. She commutes and works in an office environment in a non-medical related field, so her understanding of the clinical trial process is limited. She could use all the help she can get.
* Supportive Stan - Stan, a senior (aged 65), is a supportive caregiver for his elderly mother who has early stage Alzheimer's Disease and Type 2 Diabetes. Stan has a long career in real estate as a sales agent and has a family with children and grandchildrem. He and his siblings all chip in to care for their mom, who lives in assisted living accommodations. Stan's mother forgets when to take her medication and her doctor's appointments so Stan and his siblings try to stay on top of those while also researching clinical trials for their mom. Neither Stan nor his siblings have any medical training or a background in healthcare, but want to find suitable trials that may help their mom improve her condition.

## 4. User Stories

For the Minimum Viable Product (MVP), user stories are strictly focused on enabling patients and caregivers to efficiently discover, filter, and gain basic understanding of clinical trial information, primarily facilitated by the core AVA AI assistant. Functionalities related to application, communication with coordinators, medical record uploads, or advanced community features are explicitly deferred to future versions (V2+).

## 5. Proposed Solution: Clinical Trials Resource Hub Overview

The MVP of the Clinical Trials Resource Hub is designed as a comprehensive patient-centric wrapper around ClinicalTrials.gov, the authoritative clinical trials database. The platform maintains complete data parity and filter functionality with the source while adding patient-friendly enhancements including plain language summaries, medical glossary, enhanced accessibility features, and AVA conversational guidance. This approach leverages the established authority and comprehensive data of ClinicalTrials.gov while addressing critical patient comprehension and navigation challenges.

### 5.1.1. Core Concept (Wrapper Architecture)

The core concept revolves around creating a patient-friendly interface layer over ClinicalTrials.gov that maintains complete data integrity while adding accessibility enhancements. The platform implements all ClinicalTrials.gov search filters and parameters, ensuring users can access the complete authoritative dataset through an improved interface. AVA serves as a conversational guide to help users navigate the comprehensive filter system and understand medical terminology, while plain language summaries and glossary integration address comprehension challenges without modifying source data.

### 5.1.2. Guiding Principles (Wrapper Strategy)

The development of the Clinical Trials Resource Hub MVP will be guided by the following principles:

* **Source Authority & Data Integrity:** Maintain ClinicalTrials.gov as the single source of truth. All trial data must be current, accurate, and directly linked to authoritative source pages. Never modify or interpret source clinical data.
* **Comprehensive Feature Parity:** Implement complete search and filtering functionality matching ClinicalTrials.gov capabilities. Users must be able to access the full dataset through the enhanced interface.
* **Transparent Enhancement Layering:** Clearly distinguish between authoritative ClinicalTrials.gov data and platform value-added features (summaries, glossary, tracking tools). Enhancements supplement, never replace, official information.
* **Patient-Centric Accessibility:** Add comprehension aids (plain language summaries, medical glossary, conversational guidance) while maintaining clinical accuracy and source transparency.
* **Real-time Synchronization:** Ensure platform data remains current with ClinicalTrials.gov through reliable synchronization mechanisms.
* **Privacy & Security (Core to MVP):** Adhere strictly to all relevant data privacy regulations while implementing patient-friendly features.
*   **Iterative Enhancement:** Continuously improve patient-centric features based on user feedback while maintaining unwavering commitment to source data integrity.

### 5.1.3. Search Architecture (Hybrid Approach)

To ensure the highest fidelity with the patient experience on ClinicalTrials.gov, the application employs a hybrid search architecture. This approach is designed to combine the accurate result counts from the official website's search with the rich, structured data available through its API v2.

*   **The Challenge:** The ClinicalTrials.gov website's search functionality and its public API have different filtering logic, which can lead to discrepancies in the total number of search results. For patients, seeing a consistent number is crucial for trust.
*   **The Solution:**
    1.  **Website Count First:** For any given search, the application first queries the ClinicalTrials.gov website's search page, parsing the resulting HTML to extract the exact total number of studies.
    2.  **API for Details:** Concurrently, the application queries the API v2 with the same parameters to retrieve detailed, structured information for each trial.
    3.  **Combined for Accuracy:** The application then presents the rich data from the API but displays the total count extracted from the website, ensuring the user sees the same total they would on the official site.

This hybrid model ensures that while the user benefits from the enhanced data and UX of our application, the core experience of search result totals perfectly mirrors the authoritative source, maintaining patient trust. The primary technical challenge is accurately parsing the website's HTML for the count, especially as the website's structure may change over time.

## 5.2. High-Level Architecture Sketch

The MVP of the Clinical Trials Resource Hub will be built on a focused, modular architecture designed to efficiently deliver the core patient and caregiver trial discovery and basic understanding features. The emphasis is on functionality, reliability, and establishing the foundational AVA capabilities rather than comprehensive scalability or advanced integrations for the initial release.

* **AI/ML:** Focused on leveraging LLMs and NLP for core AVA functionality.
* **Cloud Platform:** AWS/Azure/GCP (utilizing essential services like compute, basic storage, and managed database services for MVP scale).

## 5.3. Detailed Feature Descriptions

This section describes the detailed features included in the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Each feature is directly aligned with the core MVP user stories, enabling easy clinical trial discovery and basic understanding via the AVA AI assistant. Features not listed here are explicitly deferred to future versions (V2+).

### 5.3.1. User Onboarding & Profile Management (MVP Focus)

* **New User Registration & Login:**
    * **MVP Scope:** Users can register an account (email/password, potentially Google/Apple single sign-on) and log in to access saved trials and basic profile information. Authentication is secure.
    * **Rationale:** Essential for personalization (saving trials) and basic user management.
* **Personal Profile Creation & Management:**
    * **MVP Scope:** Users can create and manage a very basic profile (e.g., name, contact email, basic demographic data like age range, gender, geographic location) necessary for initial trial filtering. This profile will not store sensitive health information in the MVP.
    * **Rationale:** Supports basic filtering capabilities for trial search and provides a persistent user experience for saved trials.
* **Saved Trials:**
    * **MVP Scope:** Users can 'save' or 'bookmark' trials from search results or detailed views to a personal list for easy revisiting. This list will display basic trial summaries.
    * **Rationale:** Supports the "save trials of interest" user story and provides a core utility for users evaluating multiple options.

### 5.3.2. Clinical Trial Discovery & Search (MVP Core)

* **Intelligent Search Bar:**
    * **MVP Scope:** A prominent search bar allowing users to input initial keywords (e.g., disease names, conditions, trial IDs, general queries like "cancer trials in Boston"). The search functionality will prioritize returning relevant clinical trials based on disease/condition and location, leveraging data from ClinicalTrials.gov. Auto-suggestions and basic typo correction will be implemented.
    * **Rationale:** Direct support for "easy search for clinical trials."
* **Advanced Filtering & Sorting:**
    * **MVP Scope:** Users can apply basic filters to search results such as disease/condition, location (city/state), and basic demographic criteria (e.g., age range, gender). A universal search field will allow filtering by any other criteria available on ClinicalTrials.gov, such as intervention, drug, study status, or eligibility criteria. Sorting options will include relevance, date posted, or distance.
    * **Rationale:** Direct support for "easy filter trial search results."
* **Trial Listing & Summaries:**
    * **MVP Scope:** Rather than presenting an overwhelming list, AVA will iteratively refine search results through conversational interaction. After initial search input or each subsequent filter application, AVA will provide an updated total count of matching trials. Users will be guided by AVA to apply additional conversational filters (e.g., "Are you looking for trials for a specific age group?", "Do you have any specific treatment preferences?") to narrow down the results. Plain-language summaries for the matching trials will be automatically provided by AVA *only when the number of trials is narrowed down to a manageable threshold (e.g., 10 or fewer studies)*. A "user-defined threshold" is a specific MVP feature (e.g., "As a user, I want to define how many summarized trials AVA presents at once...") that empowers the user even more. For searches resulting in more than 10 trials, users can explicitly request to view summaries (this may be a premium feature in later iterations to cover API costs), or continue refining. Clicking on a trial (summary or title) will lead to the official, full trial details link on ClinicalTrials.gov.
    * **Rationale:** Supports "easy viewing of detailed trial information" by making the list digestible and relevant, leveraging AVA's conversational capabilities to reduce information overload.

### 5.3.3. AVA AI Assistant Core Functionality (MVP Differentiator)

* **Conversational Interface:**
    * **MVP Scope:** AVA, an AI voice agent, is a voice-first two-way real-time conversational interface (with text input as a readily available alternative). The primary interaction model will be an intuitive voice chat-based interface, enabling real-time, natural conversation with AVA. Users will initiate queries and receive responses vocally, mimicking a natural dialogue. Text input will be available as an alternative option if the user prefers to type. AVA will provide responses in a clear, empathetic, and plain-language manner. The interface will support continuous conversation within a session, including maintaining context during search refinement.

The visual design concept for AVA is as follows:
![AVA Design Concept](../../frontend/public/assets/ava_design.png)
    * **Rationale:** The core interaction model for AVA, delivering on the vision of an "empathetic AI Voice Assistant" and enabling simplified understanding through natural dialogue.
* **Conversational Search Refinement:**
    * **MVP Scope:** AVA will actively guide users through the process of refining their clinical trial searches. After an initial broad query, AVA will suggest additional filters or clarifying questions to narrow down the results, dynamically updating the count of matching trials. This iterative process will continue until a manageable number of highly relevant trials are identified for summary presentation.
    * **Rationale:** Directly addresses the user's need to avoid overwhelming search results and leverages AVA's conversational intelligence for efficient trial discovery.
* **Medical Term Simplification:**
    * **MVP Scope:** AVA can identify complex medical jargon or clinical trial-specific terms within trial descriptions or user queries and provide simplified, plain-language explanations. This will be triggered either by user request (e.g., "What does 'placebo-controlled' mean?") or contextually within a trial summary.
    * **Rationale:** Direct support for "AVA to summarize complex medical terms."
* **Eligibility Criteria Interpretation:**
    * **MVP Scope:** AVA can parse and simplify the core inclusion/exclusion criteria for a specific trial, highlighting key requirements in plain language (e.g., "You must be between 18 and 65 years old," "You must have been diagnosed with X condition within the last 6 months"). AVA will not provide medical advice or determine actual eligibility but will interpret the criteria.
    * **Rationale:** Direct support for "AVA to explain basic eligibility criteria."
* **Contextual Query Answering (General Trial Info):**
    * **MVP Scope:** AVA can answer general, open-ended questions about the clinical trial process, what to expect, common terms, and the importance of trials, drawing from a pre-defined knowledge base and publicly available information about clinical trials. This is distinct from trial-specific data.
    * **Rationale:** Direct support for "ask AVA open-ended questions about general clinical trial processes or specific terms."
* **Empathy & Tone Management:**
    * **MVP Scope:** AVA's responses will maintain an empathetic, supportive, and compassionate tone appropriate for patients and caregivers navigating health challenges.
    * **Rationale:** Essential for the core value proposition of an "empathetic" AI.

### 5.3.4. Platform Feedback (MVP Essential)

* **User Feedback Mechanism:**
    * **MVP Scope:** Users can easily provide feedback on AVA's responses (e.g., thumbs up/down, short text comments) and general platform usability. This feedback will be crucial for iterative improvements.
    * **Rationale:** Critical for validating the MVP and guiding future development.

### 5.3.5. Internal Metrics & Administration (MVP Baseline)

* **User Interaction Analytics:**

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements define the quality attributes of the system for the MVP. These are critical for establishing a reliable and secure foundation, and for enabling initial user adoption and positive experience. Future versions will expand upon these requirements.

### 6.1. Performance & Scalability (MVP Baseline)

* **Response Time:**
    * Search results display within 3 seconds for typical MVP-scoped queries - target: 90th percentile of search results display within 3 seconds for queries involving single disease/condition and location. Action: implement client-side and server-side performance monitoring to track this metric.
    * AVA responses within 3 seconds for conversational turns (acknowledging voice processing overhead) - target: 90th percentile of AVA conversational turns (including voice-to-text and text-to-speech processing) should complete within 3 seconds. Action: Benchmark different LLM providers and voice processing APIs to understand realistic performance. Optimize API calls and data transfer for AVA interactions.
    * Page load times under 1-2 seconds - (e.g., Time to Interactive, Largest Contentful Paint) for every page - target: 90th percentile of initial page load (Time to Interactive) for the home page and search results page should be under 1-2 seconds on a standard broadband connection. Action: Conduct web performance audits (e.g., Lighthouse, WebPageTest) regularly. Optimize asset loading, image sizes, and client-side rendering.
* **Throughput:** Support for 50-100 concurrent users (e.g., active session, performing an action within a 60-second window) for initial MVP launch. Action: Plan for basic load testing scenarios targeting this concurrency level before MVP launch. Use tools like JMeter.
* **Scalability:** The MVP architecture will be designed to be horizontally scalable in principle, but the initial deployment will focus on cost-efficiency for the expected MVP load. Significant scaling beyond initial concurrent users is a V2+ focus. The MVP architecture will leverage stateless services and containerization (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes-readiness) to ensure horizontal scalability in principle, allowing for efficient scaling in future iterations while prioritizing cost-efficiency for the initial MVP load. Action: Choose cloud services that offer managed scaling (e.g., AWS ECS/EKS, Azure Kubernetes Service, Google Cloud Run) for compute and managed databases for data, enabling easier future scaling.
* **Load Handling:** Graceful degradation under expected peak MVP load. Under expected peak MVP load, the system will prioritize core functionalities (search, AVA responses) and gracefully degrade non-essential features (e.g., slower profile updates, delayed analytics processing) rather than outright failure, displaying clear user-friendly messages for any temporary unavailability. Action: Implement circuit breakers, rate limiting on APIs, and robust error handling to prevent cascading failures. Monitor system health closely during load tests and initial launch.

### 6.2. Security (Core to MVP)

## 7. Data Model (Wrapper Architecture)

The data model for the MVP defines the essential entities required to support the ClinicalTrials.gov wrapper functionality: user profiles, cached trial data with enhancements, and AVA interactions. The model maintains clear separation between authoritative ClinicalTrials.gov data and platform value-added features, ensuring data integrity and source transparency.

### 7.1. Key Entities (MVP Focus):

* **User:**
    * UserID (PK)
    * Name
    * Email
    * Password (hashed)
    * Demographics (Basic: Age Range, Gender, Location - for filtering only, not sensitive)
    * LastLoginDate (basic engagement metrics)
    * SavedTrials (List of TrialIDs)
    * *Note: Preferences and MedicalConditions/MedicalRecords are V2+.*
* **ClinicalTrial (Wrapper Model):**
    * TrialID (PK) - Maps to ClinicalTrials.gov NCT ID
    * SourceData (JSON) - Complete original data from ClinicalTrials.gov API
    * CachedTimestamp - When data was last synchronized with source
    * PlainLanguageSummary (Platform Enhancement) - AVA-generated summary for patient accessibility
    * PlainLanguageEligibility (Platform Enhancement) - Simplified eligibility criteria
    * GlossaryTerms (Platform Enhancement) - Identified medical terms with definitions
    * DistanceCalculations (Platform Enhancement) - User-specific distance data
    * OfficialClinicalTrialsGovURL - Direct link to authoritative source page
    * *Note: All core trial data (title, condition, phase, location, status, eligibility, contact info, sponsor, etc.) is retrieved directly from SourceData to ensure accuracy and currency.*
* **AVAInteraction:**
    * InteractionID (PK)
    * UserID (FK)
    * Timestamp
    * UserQuery (Text of user's query)
    * AVAResponse (Text of AVA's response)
    * Context (Reference to TrialID if query is trial-specific, or general topic)
    * Feedback (Rating, Comments - from user feedback mechanism)
    * InteractionType (e.g., 'Search Refinement', 'Term Clarification', 'General Query') to help categorize and analyze AVA's usage.
* **Deferred Entities (V2+):**
    * EducationalResource
    * TrialApplication

### 7.2. Relationships (MVP Focus):

* User saves ClinicalTrial (via SavedTrials list in User entity)
* User generates AVAInteraction
* AVAInteraction references ClinicalTrial (when the conversation is about a specific trial)

## 9. Key Assumptions

* **Access to ClinicalTrials.gov Data:** Assumed reliable and consistent access to ClinicalTrials.gov data (via API or publicly available datasets) for initial trial information.
* **User Willingness to Engage with AI:** Assumed that patients and caregivers are receptive to interacting with an AI assistant for sensitive medical information, especially given an empathetic design and clear value proposition.
* **Scalability of Core AI Models:** Assumed that foundational LLMs and NLP technologies can be scaled to meet initial MVP user demand for conversational interactions.
* **Availability of Medical Experts for Content Review:** Assumed availability of subject matter experts (medical professionals, patient advocates) to review and validate simplified medical content and AVA's explanations.
* **Data Privacy & Security Feasibility:** Assumed that adherence to HIPAA/GDPR for MVP-scoped data is technically feasible and can be achieved within the given timeline.
* **User Feedback Loop Effectiveness:** Assumed users will actively provide feedback through the platform's mechanisms, enabling continuous improvement. The feedback loop directly empowers patients and caregivers, transforming their experience from passive consumption to active contribution, leading to a continuously improving resource that truly meets their needs.

* Increased Accuracy and Reliability: By flagging incorrect or confusing information, users help the system learn and correct itself. This ensures that the medical explanations and trial summaries provided by AVA become more accurate and trustworthy over time, reducing potential misinformation.
* Enhanced Understanding: When users indicate that AVA's explanation of a medical term or eligibility criterion wasn't clear, it provides direct input for AVA to refine its plain-language simplification capabilities. This means future explanations will be even easier to grasp, reducing the emotional burden of information overload.
* More Empathetic Interactions: Feedback on AVA's tone or helpfulness allows the system to continuously adapt its conversational style, ensuring it remains supportive and compassionate, especially when users are navigating sensitive health challenges.
* Improved Search Relevance: If users consistently find search results irrelevant, their feedback guides improvements to the search and filtering algorithms, leading to more precise and useful trial discoveries in the future.
Direct Impact on Product Evolution: Patients and caregivers become co-creators of the platform. Their suggestions for new features or improvements to existing ones directly influence the product roadmap beyond MVP, ensuring the hub evolves in ways most beneficial to them.
* Validation of Value: By providing positive feedback, users validate that the AI-centric approach is indeed addressing their pain points, reinforcing the platform's core value proposition. 
Technical Implementation (MVP Focus):
The MVP implementation of the feedback loop will be lean, focusing on collecting actionable data that can directly inform immediate improvements in AVA's core functionality and platform usability.

User Interface (UI) Integration:
* Thumbs Up/Down: Directly below each AVA response and potentially each trial summary, implement simple "thumbs up" or "thumbs down" icons. This provides quick, explicit sentiment.
* Optional Text Comment Box: Alongside the thumbs up/down, offer a small, optional text box for users to provide brief comments (e.g., "Why was this helpful/unhelpful?", "Suggestions?"). This captures qualitative insights.
General Platform Feedback: A clearly visible "Feedback" link or button in the platform's footer or a dedicated section in the user's profile to capture broader usability feedback on the overall experience.

Data Collection and Storage:
* API Endpoint: A dedicated API endpoint within the API Gateway will receive feedback data from the UI.
* Feedback Entity/Table: A new table, UserFeedback, in the Database Layer (e.g., PostgreSQL) will store the collected feedback.
* FeedbackID (PK)
* UserID (FK, anonymized for privacy)
* Timestamp
* FeedbackType (e.g., 'AVA Response', 'Trial Summary', 'General UI')
* RelatedEntityID (e.g., AVAInteractionID, TrialID if feedback is specific to content)
* Sentiment (e.g., 'Positive', 'Negative' based on thumbs up/down)
* Comments (text from optional comment box)
* Logging: All feedback submissions will also be captured in the basic monitoring and logging system for auditability and troubleshooting.

Basic Processing and Analysis:
* Internal Dashboard: A simple administrative dashboard (part of the Core Content Update Interface for MVP) will display raw feedback data.
* Manual Review: A designated team member (e.g., content curator, product manager) will regularly review negative feedback and critical comments to identify patterns and specific issues.
* Basic Analytics: Leverage the User Interaction Analytics to track the volume of feedback, the ratio of positive to negative sentiment, and common keywords from comments.

Closing the Loop (MVP Actions):
* Prompt Engineering Adjustments: For AVA-related feedback, insights from comments can directly inform immediate tweaks to the prompts used to guide the Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce clearer or more empathetic responses.
* Content Refinement: If feedback highlights confusion around specific medical terms or trial eligibility criteria, the Core Content Update Interface can be used to manually refine or add entries to AVA's underlying knowledge base for simplification.
* Bug Reporting: Critical feedback about system malfunctions will be routed to the development team for bug fixes.
* Feature Prioritization: Recurring suggestions from general platform feedback can directly inform discussions about future features for V2+.
* This MVP approach ensures that the feedback mechanism is functional and provides actionable insights from day one, allowing for continuous refinement and adaptation of the core AVA experience.
